# Snake Game

### Classic Snake Game built in vanilla Javascript and HTML5

Use the keyboard arrows to change the snake's direction (right, left, up, or down). Get to the food the watch the snake grow in length. If you hit the walls of the canvas or the snake collides with it's own body you lose the game! It will restart so you can try again!
